# Problem Statement:

In this ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown we all are forced to stay at home. Work
from home, online classes, no physical activities and all day sitting on the same couch has
affected our health mentally and physically. Therefore, it’s has become very important for
us to keep ourselves healthy and fit and also fight this disease to get back to our normal
livelihood.

Considering this entire situation and health issues, our team has decided to build an
application using MIT App Inventor which will guide the application users to know their
Fitness category, how to improve their health with proper workout/diet, etc.


# Description about application and modules of application:

So here our first slide of application has a start button, clicking on which will take user to
page which has a menu bar in which there are various options for the user like as follows :

 Fitness calculator.

 Workout/Diet.

 Reminder.

 Footsteps counter.

 Meditation.

 Immune system Do’s and Don’ts

 Protein Calculator.

Whereas when the user clicks on any of these buttons their respective page will be opened!
